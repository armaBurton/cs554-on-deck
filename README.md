# cs554-on-deck
queue manager for impromptu events

## In one sentence describe what your program will do once completed.
Initially, the goal for this application was to create an app that would assist in creating and randomizing queues—the original idea being a program that would be helpful for open mics, but it would be easy enough to refactor this for other impromptu events.

## With your group, choose a programming language. What language are you using and why?
- Front End
  - TypeScript
    - I have experience working with JavaScript, but I'd like to use type control
  - React/Next.js
    - I am familiar with React, so I'm sticking to that
    - I'm curious about Next.js and would like to look into it since it is a React Framework
- Back End
  - c#
    - When the covid bubble burst and software engineers started loosing their jobs, it seemed like the c# devs-that I knew-were not as affected as the python and JavaScript devs.
    - Depending on how ambitious I feel. It is the language I am the least familiar with.
  - python
    - I want to use a different language on the back end than the front end, rather than another JavaScript framework
- Data Base
  - PostgreSQL
    - The language is simple and I am familiar with it
    - Most likely hosting on supabase
